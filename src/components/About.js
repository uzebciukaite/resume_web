          I am an outgoing person interested in learning foreign languages, playing brain battles and trivia games and enjoying long-distance walks. 
          For a year now, a new turn in my career path in Front-end Development became my biggest hobby.

          The reason why I chose Front-end Development is simply because the idea of getting visual result by writing several code lines was exciting. 
          However, with every lesson and individual practice I take my perception of Front-end Developer's potentiality scope to provide best user experience is expanding. Front-end Development is a form of art and the creation proccess motivates me to discover new ways how to improve code and project functionalities. Thus what thrills me most is the thought that programming is a never-ending learning process. You will always be able to learn some new coding language or CSS framework and thus upgrade your code and projects.
